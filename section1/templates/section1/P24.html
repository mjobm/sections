                <p>Example I:</p>
                <p>
                    Person 1 is asked: How much of the GHC 8 would you pass on to person 2?
                    It could be any amount between 0 and  8 but only full amounts (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8).
                </p>
                <p>Decision of person 1: <strong>GHC 3</strong></p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>
                    Person 2 is asked at the same time: Person 1 received GHC 8.
                    How much does he/she needs to pass on to you (from GHC 8) that you
                    would accept the offer?
                </p>
                <p>Decision of person 2: <strong>GHC 2</strong></p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>
                    Payment: Person 1 would pass on GHC 3. Person 2 only claims GHC 2 to accept the offer.
                    Therefore this distribution will be implemented. Person 1 earns GHC 5 (GHC 8 â€“ GHC 3 = GHC 5).
                    Person 2 earns GHC 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will give you one other example on the next page.
                </p>
            </li>

                <p>Example II:</p>
                <p>
                    Person 1 is asked: How much of the GHC 8 would you pass on to person 2?
                    It could be any amount between 0 and  8 but only full amounts (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Decision of person 1: <strong>GHC 5</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Person 2 is asked at the same time: Person 1 received GHC 8. How much does he/she needs to pass
                    on to you (from GHC 8) that you would accept the offer?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Decision of person 2: <strong>GHC 7</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Payment: </p>
                <p>
                    Person 1 would pass on GHC 5. However, person 2 claims GHC 7 to accept the offer.
                    Therefore this distribution will not be implemented. Person 1 earns GHC 0.
                    Person 2 earns GHC 0
