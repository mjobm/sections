        <p>
            The computer will randomly chose if you will be paid for the
            role of person 1 or the role of person 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the computer picks you to take up the role of person 1,
            you will earn the payoff you chose for yourself if person 2 accepts your offer.
            Otherwise, you and person 2 will earn nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the computer picks you to take up the role of person 2,
            you will earn the payoff that person 1 that you are paired with
            chose for person 2 but only if you had accepted that particular offer.
            Otherwise, you both earn nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will only learn at the very end of todayâ€˜s session how much you earned in
            this activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will give you an example on decisions of a person 1 and
            a person 2 and the resulting payoffs on  the following pages.
