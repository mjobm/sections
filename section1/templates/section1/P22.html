        <p>We have finished subsection 1b and will now start with subsection 1c.</p>
        <p>You have finished section 1b. Now, we move on to section 1c.</p>
        <p>
            We start now with the instructions for phase 1c.In this phase 1c,
            the computer will randomly pair you with one other participant in the room.
            You will not learn who this other participant is and the participant you are
            matched with will not learn who you are.
        </p>
        <p>In this section, the situation is as follows:</p>
        <p>
            Person 1 is matched with person 2. Person 1 will receive GHC 8 and can decide how
            much of the GHC 8, he/she wants to pass on to person 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Person 2 knows that person 1 has been called to make this decision,
            and may either accept the distribution chosen by person 1, or reject it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In case that person 2 accepts person 1â€™s proposed distribution,
            that distributions will be implemented. If person 2 rejects the offer, both receive nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will have to make decisions as if you were person 1 and also as if you were person 2.
            In the latter case, you will have to decide when you would accept or
            reject possible distributions offered by person 1.
        </p>
