                <p>Example I:</p>
                <p>
                    What is is the minimum (and equal) amount x where you would
                    switch from the left allocation to the right allocation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Minimum x: <strong>3</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Payoffs:</p>
                <p>
                    The person A decided that the minimum equal amount x where he/she would
                    would switch from left to right is GHC 3.
                    The purple line on the right indicates the switching point at x=3.
                    From there on, person A always prefers equal outcomes over the
                    money allocation on the left.
                </p>

                    The computer randomly picks one decision for payment.
                    Let us assume the computer picks decision 3.
                    The payoff for both, person A and person B would be GHC 3 in this case.
